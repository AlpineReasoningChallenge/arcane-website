I'm developing a nextjs/supabase website hosted on vercel. It MUST be reactive and support phones, tablets, and computers. The website is for "Arcane", a virtual puzzle hunt competition with a stylized magic/runic theme. The home page should have information/details about the competition, including a hero page and a FAQ.

Users must authentacate by making an account/logging in before being able to access their dashboard.

Based on this information, can you generate a set of describing this website in detail in markdown?
